# BladeOne Blade Template Engine
BladeOne is a standalone version of Blade Template Engine that uses a single PHP file and can be ported and used in different projects. It allows you to use blade template outside Laravel.

Бладеоне-это отдельная версия ядра Blade-шаблонов, которая использует один PHP-файл и может быть портирована и использована в различных проектах. Он позволяет использовать шаблон Blade за пределами laravel.

## Laravel blade tutorial

You can find some tutorials and example on the folder [Examples](examples).

## About this version
By standard, The original Blade library is part of Laravel (Illuminate components) and to use this template library, you require to install Laravel and Illuminate-view components.
The syntax of Blade is pretty nice and bright. It's based in C# Razor (another template library for C#). It's starting to be considered a de-facto standard template system for many PHP (Smarty has been riding off the sunset since years ago) so, if we can use it without Laravel then its a big plus for many projects. 
In fact, in theory, it is even possible to use with Laravel.
Exists different version of Blade Template that runs without Laravel but most requires 50 or more files and those templates add a new level of complexity, so they are not removing Laravel but hiding:

- More files to manages.
- Changes to the current project (if you want to integrate the template into an existent one)
- Incompatibilities amongst other projects.
- Slowness (if your server is not using op-cache)
- Most of the code in the original Blade is used for future use, including the chance to use a different template engine.
- Some Laravel legacy code.

This project uses a single file called BladeOne.php and a single class (called BladeOne). 
If you want to use it then include it, creates the folders and that's it!. Nothing more (not even namespaces)*[]:  It is also possible to use Blade even with Laravel or any other framework. After all, BladeOne is native, so it's possible to integrate into almost any project.

## Why to use it instead of native PHP?

### Separation of concerns
Let’s say that we have the next code

```php
//some PHP code
// some HTML code
// more PHP code
// more HTML code.
```
It leads to a mess of a code.  For example, let’s say that we oversee changing the visual layout of the page. In this case, we should change all the code and we could even break part of the programming.   
Instead, using a template system works in the next way:
```php
// some php code
ShowTemplate();
```
We are separating the visual layer from the code layer.  As a plus, we could assign a non-php-programmer in charge to edit the template, and he/she doesn’t need to touch or know our php code.
## Security
Let’s say that we have the next exercise (it’s a dummy example)
```php
$name=@$_GET['name'];
echo "my name is ".$name;
```
It could be separates as two files:
```php // index.php
$name=@$_GET['name'];
include "template.php";
```
```php 
// template.php
echo "my name is ".$name;
```
Even for this simple example, there is a risk of hacking.   How?  A user could sends malicious code by using the GET variable, such as html or even javascript. The second file should be written as follow:
```php 
 // template.php
echo "my name is ".html_entities($name);
```
html_entities should be used in every single part of the visual layer (html) where the user could injects malicious code, and it’s a real tedious work.   BladeOne does it automatically.
```php 
// template.blade.php
My name is {{$name}}
```
## Easy to use

BladeOne is focused on an easy syntax that it's fast to learn and to write, while it could keep the power of PHP.  

Let's consider the next template:

```php // template.php
<select>
    <? foreach($countries as $c) { ?>
        <option value=<? echo html_entities($c->value); ?> > <? echo html_entities($c->text); ?></option>
    <? } ?>
</select>
```
With BladeOne, we could do the same with
```php // template.blade.php
<select>
    @foreach($countries as $c)
        <option value={{$c->value}} >{{echo html_entities($c->text)}}</option>
    @nextforeach
</select>
```
And if we use thehtml extension we could even reduce to

```php // template.blade.php
@select('id1')
    @items($countries,'value','text','','')
@endselect()
```




### Performance

This library works in two stages.   

The first is when the template is called the first time. In this case, the template is compiled and stored in a folder.   
The second time the template is called then, it uses the compiled file.   The compiled file consist mainly in native PHP, so **the performance is equals than native code.** since the compiled version IS PHP.

### Scalable

You could add and use your own function by adding a new method (or extending) to the BladeOne class. NOTE: The function should start with the name "compile"
```php
protected function compileMyFunction($expression)
{
    return $this->phpTag . "echo 'YAY MY FUNCTION IS WORKING'; ?>";
}
```

Where the function could be used in a template as follow
```php
@myFunction('param','param2'...)
```
Alternatively, BladeOne allows to run arbitrary code from any class or method if its defined.
```php
{{SomeClass::SomeMethod('param','param2'...)}}
```
## Install (pick one of the next one)

1) Download the file manually then unzip (using WinRAR,7zip or any other program) https://github.com/EFTEC/BladeOne/archive/master.zip
2) git clone https://github.com/EFTEC/BladeOne
3) Composer. See [usage](#usage)
4) wget https://github.com/EFTEC/BladeOne/archive/master.zip
   unzip master.zip

## Usage

### Without composer's autoload.php
example.php:
```php
include "lib/BladeOne.php"; // you should change it and indicates the correct route.
Use eftec\bladeone;

$views = __DIR__ . '/views'; // it uses the folder /views to read the templates
$cache = __DIR__ . '/cache'; // it uses the folder /cache to compile the result. 
$blade=new bladeone\BladeOne($views,$cache,BladeOne::MODE_AUTO));
echo $blade->run("hello",array("variable1"=>"value1")); // /views/hello.blade.php must exist
```

### Without namespace nor composer

```php
include "../lib/BladeOne.php";

// The nulls indicates the default folders. By drfault it's /views and /compiles
// \eftec\bladeone\BladeOne::MODE_DEBUG is useful because it indicates the correct file if the template fails to load.  
//  You must disable it in production. 
$blade=new \eftec\bladeone\BladeOne(null,null,\eftec\bladeone\BladeOne::MODE_DEBUG);

echo $blade->run("Test.hello", []); // the template must be in /views/Test/hello.blade.php
```

### With composer's autoload.php

```php
require "vendor/autoload.php";

Use eftec\bladeone;

$views = __DIR__ . '/views';
$cache = __DIR__ . '/cache';
$blade=new bladeone\BladeOne($views,$cache,BladeOne::MODE_AUTO);
echo $blade->run("hello",array("variable1"=>"value1"));
```

Run the next composer command:  

> composer require eftec/bladeone


Where `$views` is the folder where the views (templates not compiled) will be stored. 
`$cache` is the folder where the compiled files will be stored.

In this example, the BladeOne opens the template **hello**. So in the views folder it should exist a file called **hello.blade.php**

views/hello.blade.php:
```html
<h1>Title</h1>
{{$variable1}}
```

## Security (optional)

```php
require "vendor/autoload.php";

Use eftec\bladeone;

$views = __DIR__ . '/views';
$cache = __DIR__ . '/cache';
$blade=new bladeone\BladeOne($views,$cache,BladeOne::MODE_AUTO);

$blade->login('johndoe','admin'); // where johndoe is an user and admin is the role. The role is optional

echo $blade->run("hello",array("variable1"=>"value1"));
```

If you log in using blade then you could use the tags @auth/@endauth/@guest/@endguest


```html
@auth
    // The user is authenticated...
@endauth

@guest
    // The user is not authenticated...
@endguest
```

or

```html
@auth('admin')
    // The user is authenticated...
@endauth

@guest('admin')
    // The user is not authenticated...
@endguest
```



## Business Logic/Controller methods

### constructor
```php
$blade=new bladeone\BladeOne($views,$compile,$mode);
```
- `BladeOne(templatefolder,compiledfolder,$mode)` Creates the instance of BladeOne.
-   **$views** indicates the folder or folders (it could be an array of folders) (without ending backslash) of where the template files (*.blade.php) are located.
-   **$compile** indicates the folder where the result of files will be saved. This folder should have write permission. Also, this folder could be located outside of the Web Root.
-   **$mode** (optional).  It sets the mode of the compile. See [setMode(mode)](#setmode) .  By default it's automatic

Example:  

```php
$blade=new bladeone\BladeOne(__DIR__.'/views',__DIR__.'/compiles');
// or multiple views:
$blade=new bladeone\BladeOne([__DIR__.'/views',__DIR__.'/viewsextras'],__DIR__.'/compiles');
```


### run
```php
echo $blade->run("hello",array("variable1"=>"value1"));
```
- run([template],[array])  Runs the template and generates a compiled version (if its required), then it shows the result.
-   template is the template to open. The dots are used for to separate folders.  If the template is called "folder.example" then the engine tries to open the file "folder\example.blade.php"
-   array (optional). Indicates the values to use for the template.  For example ['v1'=>10'], indicates the variable $v1 is equals to 10

### setMode

It sets the mode of compilation.

> If the constant BLADEONE_MODE is defined, then it has priority over setMode()

|mode|behaviour|
|---|---|
|BladeOne::MODE_AUTO|Automatic, BladeOne checks the compiled version, if it is obsolete, then a new version is compiled and it replaces the old one|
|BladeOne::MODE_SLOW|Slow, BladeOne always compile and replace with a new version.  It is useful for development|
|BladeOne::MODE_FAST|Fast, Bladeone never compile or replace the compiled version, even if it doesn't exist|
|BladeOne::MODE_DEBUG| It's similar to MODE_SLOW but also generates a compiled file with the same name than the template.


### setFileExtension($ext), getFileExtension

It sets or gets the extension of the template file. By default, it's .blade.php

> The extension includes the leading dot.

### setCompiledExtension($ext), getCompiledExtension

It sets or gets the extension of the template file. By default, it's .bladec

> The extension includes the leading dot.




### runString
```php
echo $blade->runString('<p>{{$direccion}}</p>', array('direccion'=>'cra 20 #33-58'));
```
- runString([expression],[array])  Evaluates the expression and returns the result.
-   expression = is the expression to evaluate
-   array (optional). Indicates the values to use for the template.  For example ['v1'=>10'], indicates the variable $v1 is equals to 10

### directive
It sets a new directive (command) that runs on compile time.
```php
$blade->directive('datetime', function ($expression) {
    return "<?php echo ($expression)->format('m/d/Y H:i'); ?>";
});
```
```html
@datetime($now)
```

### directiveRT
It sets a new directive (command) that runs on runtime time.
```php
$blade->directiveRT('datetimert', function ($expression) {
    echo $expression->format('m/d/Y H:i');
});
```

```html
@datetimert($now)
```


### BLADEONE_MODE (global constant) (optional)

It defines the mode of compilation (via global constant) See [setMode(mode)](#setmode) for more information.

```php
define("BLADEONE_MODE",BladeOne::MODE_AUTO);
```

- `BLADEONE_MODE` Is a global constant that defines the behaviour of the engine.
- Optionally, you could use `$blade->setMode(BladeOne::MODE_AUTO);`

## Template tags

### Template Inheritance

### In the master page (layout)
|Tag|Note|
|---|---|
|@section('sidebar')|Start a new section|
|@show|Indicates where the content of section will be displayed|
|@yield('title')|Show here the content of a section|

### Using the master page (using the layout)
|Tag|Note|
|---|---|
|@extends('layouts.master')|Indicates the layout to use|
|@section('title', 'Page Title')|Sends a single text to a section|
|@section('sidebar')|Start a block of code to send to a section|
|@endsection|End a block of code|


Note :(*) This feature is in the original documentation but it's not implemented either is it required. Maybe it's an obsolete feature.

### variables
|Tag|Note|
|---|---|
|{{$variable1}}|show the value of the variable using htmlentities (avoid xss attacks)|
|@{{$variable1}}|show the value of the content directly (not evaluated, useful for js)|
|{!!$variable1!!}|show the value of the variable without htmlentities (no escaped)|
|{{ $name or 'Default' }}|value or default|
|{{Class::StaticFunction($variable)}}|call and show a function (the function should return a value)|

### logic
|Tag|Note|
|---|---|
|@if (boolean)|if logic-conditional|
|@elseif (boolean)|else if logic-conditional|
|@else|else logic|
|@endif|end if logic|
|@unless(boolean)|execute block of code is boolean is false|

### loop

#### @for($variable;$condition;$increment) / @endfor
_Generates a loop until the condition is meet and the variable is incremented for each loop_   

|Tag|Note|Example|
|---|---|---|
|$variable|is a variable that should be initialized.|$i=0|  
|$condition|is the condition that must be true, otherwise the cycle will end.|$i<10|
|$increment|is how the variable is incremented in each loop.|$i++|

Example:   
```html
@for ($i = 0; $i < 10; $i++)
    The current value is {{ $i }}<br>
@endfor
```
Returns:   
```html
The current value is 0
The current value is 1
The current value is 2
The current value is 3
The current value is 4
The current value is 5
The current value is 6
The current value is 7
The current value is 8
The current value is 9
```

#### @inject('variable name', 'namespace')

```html
@inject('metric', 'App\Services\MetricsService')
<div>
    Monthly Revenue: {{ $metric->monthlyRevenue() }}.
</div>
```

By default, BladeOne creates a new instance of the class `'variable name'` inside `'namespace'` with the parameterless constructor.

To override the logic used to resolve injected classes, pass a function to `setInjectResolver`.


Example with Symphony Dependency Injection.
```php
$containerBuilder = new ContainerBuilder();
$loader = new XmlFileLoader($containerBuilder, new FileLocator(__DIR__));
$loader->load('services.xml');

$blade->setInjectResolver(function ($namespace, $variableName) use ($loader) {
    return $loader->get($namespace);
});
```



#### @foreach($array as $alias) / @endforeach
Generates a loop for each values of the variable.    

|Tag|Note|Example|
|---|---|---|
|$array|Is an array with values.|$countries|  
|$alias|is a new variable that it stores each interaction of the cycle.|$country|

Example: ($users is an array of objects)
```html
@foreach($users as $user)
    This is user {{ $user->id }}
@endforeach
```
Returns:
```html
This is user 1
This is user 2
```

#### @forelse($array as $alias) / @empty / @endforelse
Its the same as foreach but jumps to the `@empty` tag if the array is null or empty   

|Tag|Note|Example|
|---|---|---|
|$array|Is an array with values.|$countries|  
|$alias|is a new variable that it stores each interaction of the cycle.|$country|


Example: ($users is an array of objects)
```html
@forelse($users as $user)
    <li>{{ $user->name }}</li>
@empty
    <p>No users</p>
@endforelse
```
Returns:
```html
John Doe
Anna Smith
```

#### @while($condition) / @endwhile
Loops until the condition is not meet.

|Tag|Note|Example|
|---|---|---|
|$condition|The cycle loops until the condition is false.|$counter<10|  


Example: ($users is an array of objects)
```html
@set($whilecounter=0)
@while($whilecounter<3)
    @set($whilecounter)
    I'm looping forever.<br>
@endwhile
```
Returns:
```html
I'm looping forever.
I'm looping forever.
I'm looping forever.
```

#### @splitforeach($nElem,$textbetween,$textend="")  inside @foreach
This functions show a text inside a `@foreach` cycle every "n" of elements.  This function could be used when you want to add columns to a list of elements.   
NOTE: The `$textbetween` is not displayed if its the last element of the last.  With the last element, it shows the variable `$textend`

|Tag|Note|Example|
|---|---|---|
|$nElem|Number of elements|2, for every 2 element the text is displayed|  
|$textbetween|Text to show|`</tr><tr>`| 
|$textend|Text to show|`</tr>`| 

Example: ($users is an array of objects)
```html
<table border="1">
<tr>
@foreach($drinks7 as $drink)
    <td>{{$drink}}</td>
    @splitforeach(2,'</tr><tr>','</tr>')
    @endforeach
</table>
```
Returns a table with 2 columns.

#### @continue / @break
Continue jump to the next iteration of a cycle.  `@break` jump out of a cycle.

|Tag|Note|Example|
|---|---|---|

Example: ($users is an array of objects)
```html
@foreach($users as $user)
    @if($user->type == 1) // ignores the first user John Smith
    @continue
    @endif
    <li>{{ $user->type }} - {{ $user->name }}</li>

    @if($user->number == 5) // ends the cycle.
        @break
    @endif
@endforeach
```
Returns:
```html
2 - Anna Smith
```
### switch / case

_Example:(the indentation is not required)_
```html
@switch($countrySelected)
    @case(1)
        first country selected<br>
    @break
    @case(2)
        second country selected<br>
    @break
    @defaultcase()
        other country selected<br>
@endswitch()
```

- `@switch` The first value is the variable to evaluate.
- `@case` Indicates the value to compare.  It should be run inside a @switch/@endswitch
- `@default` (optional) If not case is the correct then the block of @defaultcase is evaluated.
- `@break` Break the case
- `@endswitch` End the switch.

### Sub Views
|Tag|Note|
|---|---|
|@include('folder.template')|Include a template|
|@include('folder.template',['some' => 'data'])|Include a template with new variables|
|@each('view.name', $array, 'variable')|Includes a template for each element of the array|
Note: Templates called folder.template is equals to folder/template

## @include
It includes a template

You could include a template as follow:
```html
<div>
    @include('shared.errors')
    <form>
        <!-- Form Contents -->
    </form>
</div>
```

You could also pass parameters to the template
```html
@include('view.name', ['some' => 'data'])
```
### @includeif

Additionally, if the template doesn't exist then it will fail. You could avoid it by using includeif
```html
@includeIf('view.name', ['some' => 'data'])
```
### @includefast

`@Includefast` is similar to `@include`. However, it doesn't allow parameters because it merges the template in a big file (instead of relying on different files), so it must be fast at runtime by using more space on the hard disk versus less call to read a file.


```html
@includefast('view.name')
```

>This template runs at compile time, so it doesn't work with runtime features such as @if() @includefast() @endif()

## Comments
|Tag|Note|
|---|---|
|{{-- text --}}|Include a comment|

### Stacks
|Tag|Note|
|---|---|
|@push('elem')|Add the next block to the push stack|
|@endpush|End the push block|
|@stack('elem')|Show the stack|

## @set (new for 1.5)
```
@set($variable=[value])
```
`@set($variable)` is equals to `@set($variable=$variable+1)`
- `$variable` defines the variable to add. If not value is defined and it adds +1 to a variable.
- value (option) define the value to use.

### Service Inject
|Tag|Note|
|---|---|
|@inject('metrics', 'App\Services\MetricsService')|Used for insert a Laravel Service|NOT SUPPORTED|

## Asset Management

The next libraries are designed to work with assets (CSS, JavaScript, images and so on). While it's possible to show an asset without a special library but it's a challenge if you want to work with relative path using an MVC route.

For example, let's say the next example:
http://localhost/img/resource.jpg

you could use the full path.
```html
<img src='http://localhost/img/resource.jpg' />
```
However, it will fail if the server changes.
So, you could use a relative path.
```html
<img src='img/resource.jpg' />
```
However, it fails if you are calling the web
http://localhost/controller/action/

because the browser will try to find the image at
http://localhost/controller/action/img/resource.jpg
instead of
http://localhost/img/resource.jpg

So, the solution is to set a base URL and to use an absolute or relative path

Absolute using `@asset`
```html
<img src='@asset("img/resource.jpg")' />
```
is converted to
```html
<img src='http://localhost/img/resource.jpg' />
```

Relative using @relative
```html
<img src='@relative("img/resource.jpg")' />
```
is converted to (it depends on the current url)
```html
<img src='../../img/resource.jpg' />
```

It is even possible to add an alias to resources. It is useful for switching from local to CDN.

```php
$blade->addAssetDict('js/jquery.min.js','https://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/3.3.1/jquery.min.js');
```
so then
```html
@asset('js/jquery.min.js')
```

returns
```html
https://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/3.3.1/jquery.min.js
```

:file_folder: Example: [BladeOne/examples/relative1/relative2/callrelative.php](https://github.com/EFTEC/BladeOne/blob/master/examples/examplerelative.php)


### @asset
It returns an absolute path of the resource. 

```html
@asset('js/jquery.js')
```
Note: it requires to set the base address as 
```php
$obj=new BladeOne();
$obj->setBaseUrl("https://www.example.com/urlbase/"); // with or without trail slash
```
> Security: Don't use the variables $SERVER['HTTP_HOST'] or $SERVER['SERVER_NAME'] unless the url is protected or the address is sanitized.

### @resource

It's similar to `@asset`. However, it uses a relative path.
```
@resource('js/jquery.js')
```


Note: it requires to set the base address as 
```php
$obj=new BladeOne();
$obj->setBaseUrl("https://www.example.com/urlbase/"); // with or without trail slash
```

### setBaseUrl($url)
It sets the base url.

```php
$obj=new BladeOne();
$obj->setBaseUrl("https://www.example.com/urlbase/"); // with or without trail slash
```


### getBaseUrl()
It gets the current base url.

```php
$obj=new BladeOne();
$url=$obj->getBaseUrl(); 
```

### addAssetDict($name,$url)
It adds an alias to an asset. It is used for `@asset` and `@relative`. If the name exists then `$url` is used.

```php
$obj=new BladeOne();
$url=$obj->addAssetDict('css/style.css','http://....'); 
```

## Differences between Blade and BladeOne

- Laravel's extension removed.
- Dependencies to other class removed (around 30 classes).
- The engine is self-contained.
- Setter and Getters removed. Instead, we are using the PHP style (public members).
- BladeOne doesn't support static calls.

## Differences between Blade+Laravel and BladeOne+BladeOneHTML

Instead of use the Laravel functions, for example Form::select
```html
{{Form::select('countryID', $arrayCountries,$countrySelected)}}
```

We have native tags as @select,@item,@items and @endselect
```html
@select('countryID')
    @item('0','--Select a country--',$countrySelected)
    @items($arrayCountries,'id','name',$countrySelected)
@endselect()
```

This new syntax adds an (optionally) non-selected row.
Also, BladeOneHTML adds multiple select, fixed values (without array), grouped select and many more.



## Version

- - isExpected() has an optional argument. 
- - getCompiledFile() and getTemplateFile() now uses the default template ($this->fileName) if the arg is empty (null or '')

- @break is now required for @switch/@case
- BladeOneLogic is now merged with BladeOne.  BladeOneLogic is discontinued.
- New tags of security (optional).
- New tags for injection

## todo

- @section / @show versus @endsection

- hello@@world fails to render hello@world.  However, hello @@world render hello@world.  

- extends bug. If you use extends then, every content after the last @endsetion will be rendered at the top of the page.  
  Solution: avoid to add any content after the last @endsection, including spaces and empty lines.

- Some functionalities are not available for PHP lower than 7.0.

bad example:
```html
@extends("_shared.htmltemplate")
@section("content")
@endsection
this is a bug
```

result:
```html
this is a bug
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
   <head>....</head>
   <body>....</body>
</html>
```

bad too: (check the empty line at the bottom).  This is not as bad but a small annoyance.
```html
@endsection(line carriage)
(empty line)
```

good:
```html
@endsection
```
## SourceGuardian

This library is compatible with [SourceGuardian](https://www.sourceguardian.com).   
 
>SourceGuardian provides full PHP 4, PHP 5 and PHP 7 support including the latest PHP 7.2 along with many other protection and encryption features.
 
However:  
 
* You must avoid encoding the template folder (copy unencoded the views folder).
* Optionally, you must avoid encoding the compiled folder because the files could be replaced by Bladeone. Also, you could run BladeOne in mode `BladeOne::MODE_FAST` and encode the compile folder)      

So,   
* **\view** folder = copy unencoded.
* **\compiled** folder (BladeOne::MODE_FAST)= php/html script (encode)
* **\compiled folder** (anything but BladeOne::MODE_FAST)= skip files (because it will be replaced)
* **(everything else)** = php/html script (encode)

I don't know about the compatibility of [Ioncube](http://www.ioncube.com/) or [Zend Guard](http://www.zend.com/en/products/zend-guard) I don't own a license of it.

## Future

## Missing

Some features are missing because they are new, or they lack documentation or they are specific to Laravel (then, they are useless without it)

- Laravel's own commands. Reason: This library is free of Laravel
- ~~Custom if. Reason: It is dangerous and odds.~~ DONE
- blade extension Reason: Extensions (that is part of the code, not in the template) is managed differently on BladeOne.
- ~~@php. Pending. I'm not so sure to implement this one. If you are using this one, then you are doing it wrong.~~ DONE
- ~~@canany. Pending. :baby_chick:~~ DONE
- ~~@can ( https://laravel.com/docs/5.6/authorization ). Pending~~ DONE
- ~~@cannot. Pending~~ DONE
- ~~@elseauth. Pending~~ DONE
- ~~@elseguest. Pending~~ DONE
- ~~@dump. Done. Ugly but it is done~~ DONE
- ~~@elsecan. Pending~~ DONE
- ~~@elsecanany. Pending :baby_chick:~~ DONE
- ~~@elsecannot. Pending~~ DONE
- ~~@endcanany. Pending :baby_chick:~~ DONE
- ~~@endcannot. Pending~~ DONE
