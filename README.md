Frameworks are great but most are wild; difficult to setup, consume lots of resources, require advanced knowledge 
of programming or knowledge of everything in some 100 page docs.

Although they have their benefits, it's a lot for a beginner, someone who is new to frameworks or someone simply behind schedule.

A typical setup process on a standard framework looks like this
 - Install composer (If it does not exists)
 - Run composer install
 - Generate app key
 - Configure env
 - Setup and run migration files
 - Configure server document root (I'm sorry if you're on a shared hosting, good luck hacking your way through)
 - And the list continues

LiteFrame is a small (micro) but powerful framework that selectively re-implements basic features of standard frameworks 
in non heartbreaking ways.
